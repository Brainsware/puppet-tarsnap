This module has grown over time based on a range of contributions from
people using it. If you follow these contributing guidelines your patch
will likely make it into a release a little quicker.

1. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and
   documentation.

   against the current master.

1. Push the branch to your fork and submit a pull request.

Please be prepared to repeat some of these steps as our contributors review

## Dependencies

The testing and development tools have a bunch of dependencies,
all managed by [bundler](http://bundler.io/) according to the
[Puppet support matrix](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/platforms.html#ruby-versions).

By default the tests use a baseline version of Puppet.

If you have Ruby 2.x or want a specific version of Puppet,
you must set an environment variable such as:

    export PUPPET_VERSION="~> 4.2.0"

Install the dependencies like so...

    bundle install

## Syntax and style

The test suite will run [Puppet Lint](http://puppet-lint.com/) and
[Puppet Syntax](https://github.com/gds-operations/puppet-syntax) to
check various syntax and style things. You can run these locally with:

    bundle exec rake test

## Running the unit tests

The unit test suite covers most of the code, as mentioned above please
add tests if you're adding new functionality. If you've not used
[rspec-puppet](http://rspec-puppet.com/) before then feel free to ask
about how best to test your new feature. To run your specific spec test
you can pass it to `SPEC`:

    bundle exec rake spec SPEC=spec/foo_spec.rb

Thank you very much in advance!
